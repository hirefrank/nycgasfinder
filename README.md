NYC Gas Finder
============

Real-time updates from stations in the NYC area that are serving gas based on transaction data. Created by @hirefrank. This project was inpsired by the gas shortage in the NYC area following Sandy.

Data is from wrightexpress.com for gas stations in a 10 mile radius of zip code 11201. I use BeautifulSoup for the HTML scraping and Tweepy's Twitter API Library. There is not much else to the code and it is currently running on AppEngine. 

Feel free to clone for your needs. I appreciate any patches to core functionality to make things a bit less hacky.
