Data is from WEX, formerly wrightexpress.com, a "premier provider of physical, digital and virtual payment card solutions". I use BeautifulSoup for the HTML scraping and Tweepy's Twitter API Library. There is not much else to the code and it is currently running on AppEngine. 

Feel free to clone for your needs. I appreciate any patches to core functionality to make things a bit less hacky. Have an idea for another data source? Let me know, frank (at) hirefrank.com.
